# ams2tibber

Conversion of AMS reader Home Assistant messages into Tibber Pulse messages

This is for Norwegian style HAN-NVE (so list 2 and 3) readouts to similar for tibber pulse - though modification for creating other DLMS list types would be pretty easy

Requires AMS reader 2.4.0 onwards for time copied from reader

Included is docker build file to build and run as a container
